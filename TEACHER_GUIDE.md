# Teacher's Guide - Tropical Forest Logging Simulator

## Optimal Strategy Comparison

This guide contains the optimal strategies for classroom discussion. **Do not share this with students before they complete the activity!**

### Strategy Performance Table

| Strategy | Final Carbon (Mg) | % Baseline | Wood Products (Mg C) | Penalty/Bonus | Final Score |
|----------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **One 25% (Year 10)** | **292.5** | **97.5%** | **30.0** | **+10** | **70.0** ⭐ OPTIMAL |
| Two 20% (Years 10, 55) | 275.5 | 91.8% | 46.3 | -40 | 52.5 |
| One 20% (Year 10) | 294.0 | 98.0% | 24.0 | +10 | 58.0 |
| One 30% (Year 10) | 291.0 | 97.0% | 36.0 | -40 | 32.0 |
| One 35% (Year 10) | 289.5 | 96.5% | 42.0 | -40 | 44.0 |
| Two 25% (Years 10, 55) | 269.9 | 90.0% | 57.3 | GAME OVER | 0.0 ❌ |
| Three 15% (Years 10, 45, 80) | 276.3 | 92.1% | 34.4 | -40 | 28.9 |

### Key Insights for Discussion

#### 1. **The Winner: One 25% Entry at Year 10 (70 points)**
- Extracts a moderate amount of timber
- Forest recovers to 97.5% over 100 years
- Gets the +10 sustainability bonus
- **Key lesson:** Sometimes less extraction with full recovery is better than more extraction with penalties

#### 2. **The Trap: Two 25% Entries (0 points - GAME OVER)**
- Students might think "more logging = more points"
- Falls to exactly 90% (GAME OVER threshold)
- Gets zero points despite high wood products
- **Key lesson:** Aggressive sustained yield is NOT sustainable in slow-recovering tropical forests

#### 3. **The Sweet Spot: 97% Threshold**
- One 30% entry falls just below 97% → gets -40 penalty → only 32 points
- One 25% entry stays above 97% → gets +10 bonus → 70 points
- **Key lesson:** Small differences in extraction intensity have major consequences

#### 4. **Multiple Entries Don't Win**
- Two 20% entries score 52.5 (with -40 penalty)
- Still loses to one 25% entry (70 points)
- **Key lesson:** Polycyclic logging causes cumulative degradation that's hard to recover from

## Discussion Questions

### Before Revealing Optimal Strategies

1. **What strategy did you try first? Why?**
   - Explore student intuitions about timber extraction vs. conservation

2. **Did anyone get GAME OVER? What happened?**
   - Discuss the 90% threshold and why it exists (ecosystem collapse)

3. **What was your highest score? What strategy did you use?**
   - Have students share their best attempts

### After Revealing Optimal Strategies

4. **Why does one 25% entry beat two 20% entries?**
   - Recovery is exponential - harder to recover when starting from lower baseline
   - Cumulative impacts of multiple entries

5. **Is the winning strategy (one 25% entry) actually "sustainable"?**
   - Forest ends at 97.5%, not 100%
   - Who benefits? (Current generation gets timber, future inherits slightly degraded forest)
   - Is 2.5% degradation acceptable?

6. **Why is the GAME OVER threshold at 90%?**
   - Represents ecosystem tipping points
   - Real-world consequences: biodiversity loss, soil degradation, microclimate changes
   - Loss of FSC certification and REDD+ funding

7. **What if the simulation was 200 years instead of 100?**
   - Would multiple moderate entries become viable?
   - How does time horizon affect decision-making?

8. **How does this relate to real-world forest management?**
   - FSC certification standards
   - REDD+ carbon credit requirements
   - Trade-offs between economic development and conservation

## Recommended Activity Flow (50 minutes)

### Phase 1: Individual Exploration (15 min)
- Students work individually to maximize their score
- Encourage experimentation with different strategies
- Record their best score and strategy

### Phase 2: Small Group Discussion (10 min)
- Groups of 3-4 share their strategies
- Identify highest score in each group
- Discuss what worked and what didn't

### Phase 3: Class Debrief (15 min)
- Reveal optimal strategies (show this table)
- Discuss why one 25% entry wins
- Explore the "GAME OVER" concept

### Phase 4: Broader Implications (10 min)
- Connect to FSC/REDD+ programs
- Discuss sustained yield vs. sustainability
- Explore intergenerational equity questions

## Extension Activities

1. **Compare Scenarios**
   - Try the same strategy in all 4 regions (Amazon, Borneo, Congo, Central America)
   - Discuss why different regions might have different constraints

2. **Economic Analysis**
   - If timber is worth $X per Mg C, what's the optimal strategy?
   - How do carbon credits change the calculation?

3. **Policy Design**
   - Should the 97% and 90% thresholds be different?
   - Should penalties be higher or lower?
   - Design your own scoring system

4. **Climate Change**
   - How might faster/slower recovery rates change optimal strategies?
   - What if the baseline drops due to climate stress?

## Common Student Misconceptions

1. **"More logging always means more points"**
   - Corrected by: GAME OVER mechanism and penalties

2. **"Multiple small cuts are safer than one big cut"**
   - Corrected by: Showing cumulative degradation (two 25% = GAME OVER)

3. **"Old-growth forests absorb carbon"**
   - Corrected by: Explanation of dynamic equilibrium (growth = mortality)

4. **"Forests recover quickly"**
   - Corrected by: Recovery model (k=0.12 means 70 years to reach 96% after 25% cut)

## Answer Key

**Q: What is the absolute maximum possible score?**
**A:** Approximately 77 points - one 28% entry at Year 10 (but not possible with 5% slider increments)

**Q: With 5% slider increments, what's the realistic maximum?**
**A:** 70 points - one 25% entry at Year 10

**Q: Can you get a perfect score (no degradation) with any logging?**
**A:** No. Any logging causes some degradation. The best you can do is stay above 97% for the bonus.

**Q: What's the worst possible score?**
**A:** 0 points (GAME OVER) - any strategy that ends below 90% baseline

**Note for Teachers:** Consider using this simulator AFTER students have learned about:
- Forest carbon stocks and dynamics
- Old-growth vs. secondary forests
- FSC certification
- REDD+ programs
- Ecosystem services

This ensures they can connect the simulation to broader concepts in forest ecology and management.
