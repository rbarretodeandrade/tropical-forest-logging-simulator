═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO 1: AMAZON BASIN (BRAZIL) 🌳
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGION OVERVIEW:
Your concession is in the Brazilian Amazon, managing an FSC-certified
selective logging operation in old-growth rainforest rich in mahogany and
other high-value hardwoods.

CONTEXT:
  • Premium timber markets with international demand
  • FSC certification requirements must be maintained
  • High environmental scrutiny from NGOs and government
  • Advanced infrastructure with improved forest management training

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Available logging intensities: 0%, 15%, 25%, or 35%
  • Must maintain ≥97% carbon stocks for FSC certification
  • Must stay ≥90% to avoid severe degradation penalties
  • 100-year planning horizon

YOUR CHALLENGE:
Design a logging strategy that maximizes timber revenue while maintaining
certification standards. International buyers pay premium prices, but they
require proof of sustainable management.

SCORING:
  • ≥97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) + 10 bonus ✅
  • <97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) - 40 penalty ⚠️
  • <90% final carbon: GAME OVER - 0 points ❌

TIPS:
  • The 35% option yields high revenue but risks losing certification
  • Consider timing - when should you log to allow maximum recovery?
  • Multiple entries may seem attractive, but cumulative damage adds up

SCENARIO 2: SE ASIAN DIPTEROCARP (BORNEO) 🌴
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGION OVERVIEW:
You're managing a dipterocarp forest concession in Borneo, characterized by
steep terrain and serving as critical orangutan habitat. REDD+ carbon credits
are available for forest conservation.

CONTEXT:
  • Difficult terrain increases logging damage and costs
  • Critical biodiversity concerns (orangutans, other endemic species)
  • REDD+ carbon credit opportunities available
  • High erosion risk on steep slopes

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Available logging intensities: 0%, 15%, 20%, or 30%
  • Must maintain ≥97% carbon stocks for REDD+ funding
  • Must stay ≥90% to maintain ecosystem function
  • Terrain limitations reduce maximum sustainable intensity

YOUR CHALLENGE:
Balance timber extraction with conservation goals. REDD+ payments can
supplement timber revenue if you maintain high carbon stocks, but logging
damage is amplified by the steep terrain.

SCORING:
  • ≥97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) + 10 bonus ✅
  • <97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) - 40 penalty ⚠️
  • <90% final carbon: GAME OVER - 0 points ❌

TIPS:
  • Notice the maximum intensity is only 30% (vs 35% in Amazon)
  • Terrain constraints mean damage is worse per % logged
  • REDD+ bonus requires staying above 97% threshold
  • Consider orangutan habitat protection requirements

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO 3: CONGO BASIN (CENTRAL AFRICA) 🦍
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGION OVERVIEW:
Your concession is in the remote Congo Basin, with minimal infrastructure and
serving as an important wildlife corridor for gorillas and forest elephants.

CONTEXT:
  • Remote location with high extraction and transport costs
  • Minimal existing infrastructure
  • Important wildlife corridor - conservation priority
  • Low accessibility limits logging equipment options

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Available logging intensities: 0%, 10%, 20%, or 35%
  • Must maintain ≥97% for conservation funding
  • Must stay ≥90% to preserve wildlife corridor function
  • Limited infrastructure affects operation efficiency

YOUR CHALLENGE:
High costs mean you need good timber revenue, but conservation priorities
and wildlife corridor status bring scrutiny. The unusual intensity options
(10%, 20%, 35%) reflect the trade-offs of remote operations.

SCORING:
  • ≥97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) + 10 bonus ✅
  • <97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) - 40 penalty ⚠️
  • <90% final carbon: GAME OVER - 0 points ❌

TIPS:
  • Notice the gap: 10%, 20%, then jump to 35%
  • This reflects reality: either light touch or heavy extraction to justify costs
  • Wildlife corridor status means severe penalties for degradation
  • Remote location means long-term planning is critical

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO 4: CENTRAL AMERICA (COSTA RICA/PANAMA) 🐒
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGION OVERVIEW:
Managing a forest concession in a Central American biological corridor with
high ecotourism value and payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs.

CONTEXT:
  • High ecotourism revenue potential
  • Payment for ecosystem services (PES) available
  • Biological corridor with connectivity priorities
  • Strong environmental protection regulations

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Available logging intensities: 0%, 10%, 20%, or 30%
  • Must maintain ≥97% for PES payments
  • Must stay ≥90% to preserve corridor function
  • Tourism revenue depends on forest quality

YOUR CHALLENGE:
You have multiple revenue streams: timber, ecotourism, and PES payments.
Heavy logging damages ecotourism potential and loses PES eligibility. Can
you find the sweet spot that maximizes total value?

SCORING:
  • ≥97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) + 10 bonus ✅
  • <97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) - 40 penalty ⚠️
  • <90% final carbon: GAME OVER - 0 points ❌

TIPS:
  • PES and ecotourism create incentives for conservation
  • The bonus for staying ≥97% represents these alternative revenues
  • Lower maximum intensity (30%) reflects conservation priorities
  • Biological corridor function requires connectivity

SCENARIO 5: FREE PLAY MODE 🎮
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGION OVERVIEW:
Unrestricted exploration mode! You're managing a generic old-growth tropical
rainforest at equilibrium (300 Mg C/ha) with no preset intensity constraints.

CONTEXT:
  • No regional restrictions or limitations
  • Full control over logging intensity (0-40% in 5% increments)
  • Test any strategy you want
  • Discover optimal approaches through experimentation

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Available logging intensities: ANY value from 0% to 40% (5% steps)
  • Must maintain ≥97% carbon stocks for bonus
  • Must stay ≥90% to avoid GAME OVER
  • 100-year simulation period

YOUR CHALLENGE:
No limits! Design the optimal strategy from scratch. Can you find the
perfect balance between timber extraction and forest conservation? Test
extreme strategies, compare multiple approaches, and discover what works.

SCORING:
  • ≥97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) + 10 bonus ✅
  • <97% final carbon: (Wood Products × 2) - 40 penalty ⚠️
  • <90% final carbon: GAME OVER - 0 points ❌

TIPS:
  • Try single heavy cuts vs. multiple light cuts
  • Test the boundaries: what's the maximum sustainable extraction?
  • Experiment with timing: early vs. late logging
  • Can you beat the constrained scenarios by finding creative solutions?

GENERAL GUIDANCE:
  • Recovery is SLOW: C(t+5) = C(t) + 0.12 × (300 - C(t))
  • After 25% logging, full recovery takes ~100 years
  • Old-growth forests are at equilibrium - NOT carbon sinks
  • Multiple entries cause cumulative degradation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                           KEY CONCEPTS FOR ALL SCENARIOS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OLD-GROWTH EQUILIBRIUM:
  • Baseline: 300 Mg C/ha (carbon neutral)
  • Tree growth = Tree mortality
  • These forests do NOT absorb carbon - they're already saturated

VERY SLOW RECOVERY:
  • Tropical forests recover exponentially toward equilibrium
  • Rate: k = 0.12 per 5-year period
  • Example: After 25% cut (300→225 Mg):
    - Year 25: 245 Mg (27% recovered)
    - Year 50: 267 Mg (56% recovered)
    - Year 75: 283 Mg (77% recovered)
    - Year 100: 294 Mg (92% recovered)

WHY SO SLOW?
  • Soil compaction from machinery
  • Microclimate changes (light, temperature, humidity)
  • Slow-growing hardwood species
  • Pioneer species must be replaced by climax species

WOOD PRODUCTS:
  • Only 40% of harvested carbon enters long-term storage
  • Rest is lost to milling, processing, short-term products
  • Score multiplier (×2) represents economic value

THRESHOLD LOGIC:
  • 97% threshold: FSC certification, REDD+ eligibility, PES payments
  • 90% threshold: Ecosystem function, biodiversity maintenance
  • Below 90%: Severe degradation - project failure
